        <h3>Mathematical & Computational Modeling | Modeling & Simulation of Complex Systems</h3>

        <p>My journey has always been fueled by a deep curiosity about complex systems — how they function, evolve, and interact. From an early foundation in life and earth sciences to engineering, and eventually a specialization in applied mathematics and computer science, I’ve been fascinated by the challenge of translating complexity into models we can simulate, analyze, and understand.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the intersection of applied mathematics, computational modeling, and machine learning, focusing on the simulation of reactive transport in porous media. My research involves developing <strong>numerical methods and graph-based models</strong> to simulate diffusion and transformation processes, essential for understanding microbial decomposition in soils and other porous environments.</p>

        <p>🚀 At the core of my research lies the fusion of <strong>physics-based simulations and AI</strong>, exploring:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>✔️ Numerical methods for PDEs in porous and complex media</li>
            <li>✔️ Geometrical and graph-based models for diffusion and transformation in 3D structures</li>
            <li>✔️ Machine learning to approximate transport properties and multi-physics processes</li>
            <li>✔️ Mathematical modeling and analysis of complex biological and physical systems</li>
            <li>✔️ Graph Neural Networks, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Generative Models, and Time-Series Forecasting</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or simply passionate about mathematical and computational modeling, feel free to connect! I'm always open to collaboration and scientific exchange.</p>
